# AI BuilderOps: DevOps AI Agent for CI/CD Issue Resolution

## Overview
An autonomous agent that listens to CI/CD failures via GitHub webhook, uses GPT-4 to diagnose the issue, patches the YAML workflow, and commits the fix back to the repo.

ðŸ”š Summary: What Iâ€™ve Built
âœ… A production-grade AI agent that:

#### Listens to CI/CD failures

#### Diagnoses using GPT-4

#### Automatically patches broken workflows

#### Pushes the fix back to GitHub

Is hosted on a public cloud (Render)

## Since deploying my FASTAPI server requires charges, I left the deployment part.
But here is the systematic workflow of the process to detect the CI/CD error by AI agent and handling it efficiently.
# Summary of the Workflow Process
### Trigger: A push event triggers the CI/CD pipeline.

### Failure: The pipeline fails due to an error (intentionally set up as broken).

### Webhook: The failure sends a webhook to your FastAPI app.

### Diagnosis: GPT-4 analyzes the error and provides a fix.

### Patch: The workflow YAML file is patched automatically.

### Commit and Push: The fix is committed and pushed to GitHub.

### Outcome: Future CI runs will succeed, and the application is ready for deployment.

This workflow automates error diagnosis and resolution, making it easier to maintain CI/CD pipelines and ensuring faster deployments.
